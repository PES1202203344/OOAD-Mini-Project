# Problem Statement:  
Managing personal stock portfolios can be complex and time-consuming, especially for individual investors. There is a need for a centralized, user-friendly platform that enables users to efficiently manage their investments, track transactions, and analyze portfolio performance in real-time. Most existing systems are either too complex for casual investors or lack essential features like real-time valuation and performance insights. 
This project aims to solve that by developing a web-based Stock Portfolio Management System that simplifies portfolio tracking, supports secure transactions (buy/sell), and provides insightful analysis to help users make informed investment decisions.
